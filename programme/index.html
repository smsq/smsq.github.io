<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract0"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  The calculus of variations is utilised to study the behaviour of a rippled graphene sheet supported on a metal substrate. We propose a model that is underpinned by two key parameters, the bending rigidity of graphene and the van der Waals interaction strength. Three cases are considered, each of which addresses a specific case of a rippled graphene sheet located on a flat substrate. The transitional case assumes a fixed length for both the graphene sheet and the substrate. The substrate constrained case assumes only the substrate has a fixed length. Finally, the graphene constrained case assumes only the length of the graphene sheet is fixed. Numerical results are presented for each case. The interpretation of all these cases demonstrates  a continuous relationship between the total energy and the substrate length, that incorporates all three cases. </abstract></td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract1"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  Understanding the interfacial heat transfer and thermal resistance at an interface between two dissimilar materials is of great importance in the development of nanoscale systems. This paper introduces a new and highly accurate method for calculating interfacial thermal resistance or Kapitza resistance in solid-fluid interfaces with the help of equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) simulations. The theoretical predictions are validated against classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD simulations are carried out in a Lennard-Jones (L-J) system with fluid confined between two solid slabs. Different types of interfaces are tested by varying the solid-fluid interactions (wetting coefficient) at the interface.It is observed that the Kapitza length decreases monotonically with an increasing wetting coefficient as expected. The theory is further validated by simulating under different conditions such as channel width, density, and temperature. Our method allows us to directly
<br />determine the Kapitza length from EMD simulations by considering the temperature fluctuation and heat flux fluctuations at the interface. The predicted Kapitza length shows an excellent agreement with the results obtained from both equilibrium and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD/NEMD) simulations. </abstract></td></tr>

From the fluctuation theorem the so-called second law inequality can be derived.  We consider if it is possible to derive that inequality without using the fluctuation theorem.  This could expand the range of systems that the second law inequality can be applied  it and would provide a second law inequality for time-asymmetric protocols. </abstract></td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract3"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  The use of organic semiconductors is a promising means by which cheap, flexible, and lightweight electronic devices may be achieved. Although already commonly used in electronic displays, a better understanding of how these molecules pack and interact, and the influence this may have on their electronic properties, would be beneficial for the more rapid development of other interesting technologies. To this end, understanding how these molecules behave in solution and how the choice of processing conditions can affect the solution-phase aggregation properties is important, as many devices are fabricated through solution processing methods. Furthermore, as solution-phase aggregation has been shown to be important for controlling orientation at important interfaces in organic semiconductor based devices which has implications for charge transport and device performance, it is hoped that understanding solution aggregation may lead to a better understanding of aggregation-controlled interfacial alignment. Computer simulations can facilitate this understanding, but conventional all-atom simulations are unfeasible for studying mesoscale assembly processes. We address this issue by using molecular dynamics simulations of coarse-grained models of representative semiconducting polymers to examine how aggregation occurs in solution and how the molecular properties and processing conditions can influence solution-phase behaviour. The importance of molecular anisotropy and whether this plays a role in determining aggregation properties is also considered in order to better understand the principles driving aggregation, and how it may be predicted from molecular structure and properties.  </abstract></td></tr>

Since many potential applications of carbon nanotubes require populations with specific properties, the selectivity of this method is important. By developing a model of the formation of carbon caps on metallic catalysts during the carbon vapour deposition process, we can study the selectivity of this process under different conditions. Using this model, we examine the effects of various parameters on the formation of carbon caps, and determine when a cap is likely to lift off from a catalyst to form a carbon nanotube. </abstract></td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract5"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  A long-standing question about the critical behaviour of the adsorption transition of polymer molecules in dilute solutions concerns whether the crossover exponent has a universal value in all dimensions and how it is affected by solvent quality, modeled by a monomer-monomer bulk interaction. 
<br />We consider the phase diagram of self-avoiding walks (SAWs) and similar models on the simple cubic lattice subject to surface and bulk interactions. In this work we simulate SAWs at specific bulk interaction strengths to focus on locating certain transitions and their critical behaviour. Recent results proposed that the large changes to the crossover exponent and the adsorption temperature as the bulk interaction strength is increased is due to multicriticality. We show that this behaviour coincides with the appearance of other phases where bulk collapse is just as important as surface adsorption and the critical temperatures are not the adsorption temperature but are indicative of a transition to these other phases. This implies a simpler picture of the variation of critical exponents due to strength of the bulk interaction and reflects the normal universal behaviour of exponents. </abstract></td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract6"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  Dynamic light scattering (DLS) is a well established technique for measuring dynamics in colloidal suspensions, and is routinely employed for particle sizing to complement imaging techniques such as electron microscopy. However, there are a range of challenging systems that are difficult to study with DLS, including: non-spherical particles; concentrated (turbid) suspensions, and active colloids such as bacteria. Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) is a relatively new technique that uses white light microscopy to measure dynamics by Fourier transformation of subtracted frames (see figure 1), and has some advantages over DLS for such systems. 
<br />
<br />In this talk we will explain the principles behind the techniques, and present novel application of both DLS and DDM to three systems: particle sizing in turbid colloidal suspensions; the measurement of dynamics of nanorods, and the characterization of bacterial motility. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each of the techniques.

<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract7"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  We study a model for dense polymer systems via a novel highly efficient Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling Hamiltonian paths, i.e. single space-filling lattice chains. The underlying lattice is simple cubic, and confined to a three-dimensional cubic box with periodic boundary conditions. We obtain extremely precise numerical results for long chains, and focus on intra-chain correlations. In the long-chain limit, we reproduce random-walk statistics, as expected from Flory screening of excluded-volume interactions in dense systems. The finite-chain corrections, indicative of not-yet perfect screening, behave like a power-law tail. On scales small compared to the box size, we find the same behaviour that has been numerically established and theoretically predicted previously for dense many-chain systems. Conversely, on scales significantly larger than the box size we find a much more rapid decay of correlations, indicative of a dramatic enhancement of Flory screening due to finite box size effects. This is a somewhat surprising result that so far lacks any theoretical explanation.

<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract8"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  Chemical vapour deposition is a popular technique for producing high-quality graphene sheets on a substrate.  However, the cooling process causes the graphene sheet to undergo a strain-induced, out-of-plane buckling resulting in graphene wrinkles. These wrinkles often lead to undesirable effects on the properties of the graphene sheet. In this talk we construct a mathematical model to understand the conformations of these wrinkles.  Initially an arch-shaped wrinkle is modelled and this is then generalised to incorporate graphene self-adhesion through van der Waals interactions across the wrinkle sides. Variational techniques are utilised to determine the lowest-energy conformation for both models.  We find these models predict lowest-energy structures similar to those seen in experiments. </abstract></td></tr>

In the first set of simulations, the xâdirectional kinetic temperature was artificially raised above the other five, and in the second, the xâdirectional configurational temperature was artificially raised above the other five. In both cases, external energy flows balanced, but unexpected energy flows between different directional components of the potential energy were observed. Additional simulations showed that these energy flows occurred regardless of the arrangement of thermostats imposed on the six degrees of freedom and the addition of shear. Heat flow between degrees of freedom that were ostensibly at the same temperature was anomalously observed. It was concluded that a different breakdown of the contributions to the configurational energy that is consistent with the definition of the directional configurational temperatures is required. </abstract></td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract11"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  We show that the solvent behaviour in both diffusio-osmosis and Marangoni flow can be derived from a simple model of colloidâinterface interactions. We demonstrate that the direction of the flow is regulated by a single value of the attractive parameter covering the purely repulsive and attractiveârepulsive interaction cases. The proposed universality between diffusio-osmosis and Marangoni flow is extended further to include diffusio-phoresis. In particular, an object immersed to a colloidal solution moves towards the low concentration of the colloidal particles in the case of colloidâinterface repulsion and towards the high concentration of the colloidal particles in the case of colloidâinterface attraction. The approach combines the methods of fluid dynamics, molecular physics and transport phenomena and provides a tractable explanation of how the colloidâinterface interactions affect the momentum balance and the transport phenomena (interfacially driven transport). </abstract></td></tr>

In this talk, I will describe our recent theoretical efforts to understand chiral crystallization with the help of a family of coarse-grained models of chiral molecules with a broad range of molecular shapes and interactions. Our simulations reproduce the experimental crystallization behavior of real chiral molecules, including racemic and enantiopure crystals, as well as amorphous solids. Using efficient algorithms for the packing of shapes, we enumerate millions of low energy crystal structures for each model and analyze the thermodynamic landscape of polymorphs. In agreement with recent conjectures, our analysis shows that the ease of crystallization is largely determined by the number of competing polymorphs with low free energy. We find that this number, and hence crystallization outcomes, depend on molecular interactions in a simple way: Strongly heterogeneous interactions across molecules promote crystallization and favor the spontaneous resolution of racemic mixtures. </abstract></td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract17"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  Conformational transitions in polymer molecules lead to a dissipation of energy due to frictional resistance from surrounding solvent molecules, and due to the presence of internal friction within molecules. The latter is linked to configurational rearrangements on an underlying energy landscape. In a rheological context, internal friction is conjectured to lead a shear-rate dependent viscosity, a finite limiting value for the infinite frequency limit of the dynamic viscosity, and to instantaneous stress jumps at the inception of steady shear flow. In a biological context, it is believed to be responsible for the slowing down of the process of protein folding, to influence stretching transitions in single biomolecule force spectroscopy, and to affect the dynamics of intermolecular interactions in intrinsically disordered proteins. The experimental quantification of internal friction has remained challenging. A novel methodology is proposed here for the experimental determination of the internal friction coefficient of polymer chains. Essentially, the average work dissipated as the molecule is stretched repeatedly is calculated by applying the Jarzynski equality, and the internal friction coefficient is then estimated in the hypothetical limit of zero solvent viscosity. The validity of the protocol is established through Brownian dynamics simulations of a single-mode spring-dashpot model for a polymer that incorporates both internal friction and solvent-mediated friction. Single-molecule manipulation techniques, such as optical tweezer-based pulling, can be used to implement the suggested protocol experimentally, and it is argued that the proposed methodology provides a means for the first time of directly estimating the magnitude of the internal friction coefficient in polymers.  </abstract></td></tr>

Individual rods are represented by a rigid linear chain consisting of overlapping spheres which interact through a pseudo-hard-core. Non-adsorbed polyremes are modelled as freely inter-penetrable spheres with respect to each other, while there is the pseudo-hard-core repulsion between the polymer and rod spheres. Solvents are considered implicitly or explicitly with a dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) model. The phase behaviour of this model, obtained from continuous compression and expansion simulations, reproduces previous predictions based on theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. The brute-force simulations and forward-flux-sampling simulations are performed with this model to investigate the nucleation mechanism and to predict the nucleation rate/barrier for the self-assembly process of hard-rod colloidal particles in non-adsorbed polyreme solutions. The diffusion coefficients of a single rod-shaped colloidal particle measured with this model are in good agreement with the predictions based on the continuum theory.

Hence, there is a pressing need for a reliable method that can provide full characterisation of these particles. Although transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provides high resolution detail of particle size, shape and structure, discerning the organic materials bound on the nanocrystal surface is still a challenge, due to low atomic contrast. Yet, parameters related to the overall hybrid particle (inorganic core and organic shell) properties influence particlesâ solubility, electronic properties, assembly and reactivity. In this context, analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) appears as an alternative to characterise these particles in solution, being sensitive to changes in the density and size of both core and shell components of nanoparticles [1]. We use molecular dynamics simulations (MD) to test the validity of the Stokes-Einstein-Sutherland (SES) equation for systems of CdSe quantum dots coated with alkanethiol ligands in chloroform and explain inconsistencies between the sedimentation trends observed in AUC experiments and the ones predicted for these particles in a Stokes flow. We find that varying the size of the particle changes the structure of the ligand shell and the way it interacts with the solvent and will dictate the diffusion and sedimentation behaviours of the nanocrystals.

In this talk, a new systematic methodology to generate CG models for molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using force matching is introduced and validated. The algorithm of this method is developed so that MD simulations can be simplified but still accurately represent the physical and thermodynamic properties of the simulated materials. More importantly, this method can produce models that capture the anisotropy of molecules, which is especially useful for theoretical studies of organic materials and has not previously been achieved via a systematic algorithm. To validate the method, CG models of typical anisotropic organic molecules are produced.

For liquids confined to a slit, this structure can be characterised by two particularly apparent features. The first is a non-uniform density profile caused by layering at the walls. The second is a non-monotonic change in the structural correlations with the wall spacing. 
<br />
<br />Here, we disentangle the effects of layering and local packing by confining a fluid to the surface of a torus or long cylinder. This is equivalent to periodic boundary conditions, where one dimension of the system is very small. We quantify correlations in this quasi-confined fluid by calculating the static structure factor with both hard-sphere computer simulations and the Percus-Yevick closure in liquid state theory. We observe that the particle correlations exhibit a similar non-monotonic behaviour to a liquid confined between two walls, even though the density is homogeneous. The dynamic properties of the fluid also reflect the non-monotonicity observed in the static properties. These results indicate that the correlations in real confined liquids may not be intrinsically related to their oscillating density profile.

<br />Organometallic halide perovskites show a promising future as an efficient and low-cost alternative for conventional photovoltaics. Devices with power conversion efficiencies over 20% have already been reported. Solution processability, high absorption coefficient and tunable bandgap make hybrid perovskites a promising alternative to silicon-based photovoltaics. However, further development is necessary before perovskite solar cells can be widely adopted by industry. For instance, they cannot currently be printed at scale. Even though a wide variety of specific fabrication methods exist to make hybrid perovskites with desired properties and composition, a molecular-level understanding of how they crystallise from solutionÂ is still lacking. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations have been used to obtain atomistic insight into some of these processes, but are limited to timescales of the order of 10s of ps. In contrast, processes on much longer timescales have been successfully studied using classical force fields for both organic and inorganic systems. A couple of attempts have been made recently to parameterise force fields for studying organometallic halide perovskites, with some success at reproducing solid-state properties. However, a force field that can accurately describe dissolution and crystallisation is still lacking. 
<br />
<br />In this work, we compare existing non-polarizable force fields developed to study the solid or  solution phases of organometallic halide perovskites with the AMOEBA polarizable force field. The aim is to test whether computationally expensive polarizable force fields like AMOEBA offer better transferability between liquid and solid phases, the ultimate goal being the study of pre-critical clusters, nucleation and interfaces of organometallic halide perovskites.

LSC's utilise total internal reflection to direct light to their edges for solar harvesting. These systems can also be built as nearly transparent allowing windows to be still used. A limitation on LSC's is the low efficiency of these systems. But, by controlling the assembly of nano-luminophores in the wave guide it is possible to increase their efficiency.

This is achieved through simulating Brownian dynamics with the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package. Several orderings of binary rods are observed both with entirely attractive and mixed interaction regimes. Some of these orderings are as predicted from hard disc packings, but new pentagonal orderings are observed as well. These results are also examined through calculating coordination. From these simulations it is observed that the correct number ratio is important to form an extended lattice. Additionally it is determined that mixed interactions are required to prevent separation of the two rod types within a lattice into separate phases.

A key feature of the solutions of associative polymers is the formation of transient gels and networks via inter-chain association between the sticky groups, and they find use in a wide range of applications including paints and coatings, drug delivery, tissue engineering and so on. To understand the statistical mechanics of associative polymer solutions, scaling relations have been proposed initially by Rubinstein and Semenov (Macromolecules 1998, 31, 1373-1385) and subsequently developed by Dobrynin (Macromolecules 2004, 37, 3881-3893) based on mean field theory. These relations correlate the intra-chain and inter-chain associations between the stickers with the chain topology (such as number of stickers per chain and the spacing between the stickers) and system parameters (such as monomer concentration, solution temperature, sticker strength etc.). There are currently no systematic simulations or experiments to validate these scaling predictions. In the present study we have developed a multi-chain Brownian dynamics (BD) algorithm to simulate coarse-grained models of associative polymers using a novel interaction potential and scrutinised the predictions of the scaling theory. By appropriate combination and rescaling of variables we have shown the universality of the scaling relations over a range of values of chain lengths, spacer lengths and other system parameters.

The simulation method is  Brownian Cluster Dynamics (BCD) by accommodating the binary spherical colloids and their selective interaction between intra-species. The model was tested by considering the irreversible diffusion limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) of binary colloids, which serves as a model for chemical gels. To explore the wide adaptability of the model, the new algorithm was also  tested by considering aggregation process in both the species and in only one species with another species being mobile/immobile hard spheres. The size and shape of the randomly distributed colloids of both the species are identical and undergo Brownian diffusion.
<br />
<br />Two cases were investigated in details: (i) kinetics and structure of the system with both species aggregating (ii) dynamics of the mobile hard-spheres, when only one species is aggregating and forming system spanning cluster.
<br />
<br />In case (i) Irreversible aggregation of binary colloidal particles lead to the formation of system spanning cluster of one species or both the species also called âbigelsâ. An inequality relation was proposed which predicts the appearance of bigels in irreversible aggregation of binary DLCA. The structures generated by binary aggregation was compared with one component system and was shown to be different with  fractal dimension 2.0, which is slightly higher than that of the monomeric system (1.8). The structures with fractal dimension 2.0 in flocculation limit were identified as branched polymers (Lattice animals). As chemical distance of a cluster in flocculation limit follows the same scaling law as predicted for lattice animals. For the fist time it was shown that irreversible binary DLCA comes under the universality class of percolation theory as it was validated  that the binary DLCA follows the scaling laws proposed by percolation theory [1].
<br />
<br />In case (ii) the dynamical study of the binary DLCA system unraveled an unknown aspect of anomalous diffusion of hard spheres: the cage dynamics of the clusters. The dynamics of the non interacting hard-spheres inside the percolating cluster was shown to be similar to the glass like dynamics in gels. Two aspects were considered, one where the percolated particles moved within the bonds or cage dynamics was allowed and other where the movement within the bonds are restricted or cage dynamics was not allowed. The hard spheres showed anomalous diffusion in both the cases as randomly diffusing hard spheres were stuck inside the cages of percolating species. The intermediate scattering function of the hard-spheres revealed that for a volume fraction of Ï < 0.49 system shows double relaxation similar to colloidal glass for smaller fraction of hard-sphere particles. For higher fraction binary system is showing only a single stretched exponential for hard spheres. In case of the static cage hard spheres showed only a single relaxation to a constant value which was indicative of the fact that the particles were permanently stuck inside the cages created by the percolating cluster. The probability distribution of particles revealed that the distribution of hard spheres in the double relaxation regime is given by a broad distribution while for the case, where system has only a single stretched relaxation it was proposed that system is possibly having a fraction as slow and fast particles [2].

<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract36"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  Confined fluids are fluids under a geometric constraint in the nanometric scale. They are present in nature and different processes, from living cells, reverse micelles, oil and gas reservoirs to nanofluidic devices. Thermodynamic and transport properties of confined fluids largely differ from the ones observed in bulk conditions. This is caused by the inhomogeneity that arises from the magnitude of the interactions between the fluid and the confining walls. Molecular simulations can be a great tool for determining the properties of confined fluids in a variety of systems but at the same time, proper methodologies for calculating local transport properties in inhomogeneous fluids are still limited. Here, we propose the use of local dissipation theorem for the calculation of local self-diffusion coefficients of confined fluids. Two case studies are consider for the validation of the methodology, the first one being a carbon nanotube filled with argon, and the second one an ionic liquid confined between graphene electrodes. The former is a simplified representation of a supercapacitor, which is the main interest of this project. Diffusivity of electrolytes is a direct indicator of power densities of supercapacitors and this kind of information can be used as a tool for guiding the enhancement of the performance of supercapacitors.  </abstract></td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract37"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  It has been known for some time, though not widely so, that the heat flux for a liquid under shear involves additional couplings apart from the well-known Fourier law which is proportional to the temperature gradient. This is true in the linear regime, arbitrarily close to equilibrium [1-3]. In this work, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) to explore the effect of shear flow on heat flux [4]. By simulating a simple fluid in a channel bounded by tethered atoms, the heat flux is computed for two systems: a temperature driven one with no flow and a wall driven, Couette flow system. The results for the temperature driven system give the Fourierâs law thermal conductivity, which is shown to agree well with experiments.
<br />
<br />Through comparison of the two systems, we quantify the additional components of the heat flux parallel and normal to the walls due to shear flow. To compute the heat flux in the flow direction, the Irving-Kirkwood equations [5] are integrated over a volume, giving the so-called volume average form, and they are also manipulated to get expressions for the surface averaged and method of planes forms [6-12]. The method of planes and volume average forms are shown to give equivalent results for the heat flux when using small volumes.
<br />
<br />The heat flux in the flow direction is obtained consistently over a range of simulations, and it is shown to vary linearly with strain rate, as predicted by theory. The additional strain rate dependent component of the heat flux normal to the wall is obtained by fitting the strain rate dependence of the heat flux to the expected form [12].
<br />
<br />As a result, the additional terms in the thermal conductivity tensor quantified in this work should be experimentally testable.

We have studied walking droplets in the presence of two driving frequencies and have observed a new class of walking droplets, which we coin superwalkers. Superwalkers may be more than double the size of the largest walkers, may travel at more than triple the speed of the fastest ones, and enable a plethora of novel multi-droplet behaviors. Physical insights from numerical simulations into the emergence of the superwalking behavior are also discussed.

<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract39"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  The dielectric constant for water is reduced under confinement. Although this phenomenon is well known, the underlying physical mechanism for the reduction is still in debate. In this work, we investigate the effect of the orientation of hydrogen bonds on the dielectric properties of confined water using molecular dynamics simulations. We find a reduced rotational diffusion coefficient for water molecules close to the solid surface. The reduced rotational diffusion arises due to the hindered rotation away from the plane parallel to the channel walls. The suppressed rotation in turn affects the orientational polarization of water, leading to a low value for the dielectric constant at the interface. We attribute the constrained out-of-plane rotation to originate from a higher density of planar hydrogen bonds formed by the interfacial water molecules. </abstract></td></tr>

<br />We look at the nucleation pathway of nanorods transitioning from an isotropic state to a more ordered state, using umbrella sampling to observe the free energy of a growing ordered cluster in the system. From this we are able to view the structure of the growing cluster and what the favoured growth pathway is.
<br />We also look at the phase behaviour of janus nanorods with an attractive and a hard repulsive segment. We examine the free energy changes with changing density using a hybrid of grand canonical monte carlo and molecular dynamics with sequential umbrella sampling. This allows us to determine the entropic contribution to any phase changes. </abstract></td></tr>

<!--<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract0"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  Packing particles on a curved surfaces is a fundamental problem in Soft Matter to explore how ordered materials interact with geometry and with applications as diverse as Pickering Emulsions and cryptography. Here, we study packings of bidispersed spherical particles on a spherical surface. The presence of curvature necessitates defects even for monodispersed particles; bidispersity either leads to a more disordered packing for nearly equal radii, or a higher fill fraction when the smaller particles are accomodated in the interstices of the larger spheres. Variation in the packing fraction is explained by a percolation transition, as chains of defects or scars previously discovered in the monodispersed case grow and eventually disconnect the neighbor graph. This new result connects the field of crystallography on curved surfaces to glasses and amorphous materials.  </abstract></td></tr>-->

Here I use Brownian dynamics simulations corresponding to using optical tweezers to hold and detach a particle from a membrane. However, the rate at which a particle is pulled out of an optical trap affects the trajectory by which the particle escapes from the trap. In this talk I shall discuss how, for a finite pulling rate, the path with which the particle detaches varies for different velocities. Likewise, the work done to detach a particle from a membrane varies depending on the escape velocity. I shall describe my simulation approach, using Crooks fluctuation theorem and Jarzynski equality, to extract a membrane potential. These simulations allow the use of optical tweezers to measure a membrane potential based on its attachment to a particle. </abstract></td></tr>-->

<!--<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract4"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  Most of us have tried this at home: smash cereal with a spoon. Yet, the science of snap, crackle and pop extends way beyond a cereal ad. In fact, using such a simple experiment we reveal surprisingly rich compaction patterns due to competing processes of internal collapse and recovery. Using a simple spring-lattice model that captures these two processes, we successfully explain previously observed patterns in cereal, snow and sandstones. Subsequently, we use the model to guide us in the discovery of novel patterns, which we confirm experimentally in cereal. A further set of experiments with cereal partially soaked by fluid (milk/water) under constant pressure reveals coherent rice-quakes that could be explained by coupled fluid diffusion and the chemical degradation of the solid matrix; similar conditions often prevail in rockfill dams, which frequently fail unexpectedly.  Our work reveals bifurcation in solids reminiscent of critical phenomena near phase transitions, and thus will be of relevance for people interested in soft matter physics, complex systems, and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. </abstract></td></tr>-->

<!--<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract5"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  The phase diagram of a Lennard-Jones fluid is similar to the one of the Ising ferromagnetic: both have a critical point, which separates the ordered phase from the disordered one. The analogy between a fluid and a ferromagnetic system has been very useful in describing critical phenomena, employing universality of the second-order phase transition. This analogy, however, is not limited to the region of small vicinity of the critical point. Comparing the topological structure of the phase diagrams of a fluid and a ferromagnetic one can conclude that there exists an isomorphism between them. This is the case in a broad interval of temperatures along the phase coexistence, and is valid both in 2D and 3D. This so-called Global Isomorphism can be used to derive properties of a complex liqud-vapor interface using much simpler lattice gas approach of the Ising model. In particular, in this work we demonstrate this for the surface tension, deriving its expression for a fluid without any fitting parameter. </abstract></td></tr>-->

<!--<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract8"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  The problem of forces experienced by an object moving in a granular material has many practical applications, and is of fundamental interest in fluid mechanics. This classical configuration has been extensively studied in Newtonian or non-Newtonian fluids, and allows to probe the rheological properties of the material. Here we study experimentally and numerically the forces experienced by a horizontal cylinder rotating around the vertical axis in a granular material. We show that the cylinder experiences a strong lift force in this configuration, proportional to its buoyancy with a high amplification factor. This effect is due to the specific properties of the granular medium, the presence of a pressure gradient modifying completely the flow around the object. A second striking observation is made after several rotations of the cylinder. The drag force dramatically drops and becomes independent of depth, showing that the object no longer perceive the weight of the grains above it. The rotation of the cylinder creates a strong stress anisotropy, that screens the weight of the grains and creates a low pressure bubble above the object. </abstract></td></tr>-->

How much entropy molecules lose upon binding, however, has proved controversial for over fifty years [1,2].

The pseudo-gas-phase Sackur-Tetrode model for a solute yields greater losses in translational and rotational entropy than the cell model. Moreover, the models have qualitative differences in their dependence on the sizes of the molecules involved.

In particular, we consider spheres with an asymmetry in the solid-liquid interaction over their surfaces and calculate the forces and torques experienced by the particles as a function of their orientation with respect to the flow. We also examine particles that are deformed slightly from a spherical shape. We compare the simulation results to the predictions of a previously introduced theoretical approach, which computes the forces and torques on particles with variable slip lengths or aspherical deformations that are much smaller than the particle radius. We find that there is good agreement between the forces and torques computed from our simulations and the theoretical predictions, when the slip condition is applied to the first layer of liquid molecules adjacent to the surface. The results allow us to estimate critical flow rates at which Janus clusters will become unstable. </abstract></td></tr>-->

Other important parameters in a deposition process such as local stresses, strain and temperature at the substrate/particle impact region are calculated under practical conditions of vacuum cold spray process.

Over a decade ago, we proposed a model to predict the collective diffusion of Knudsen flows in uniform micropores (such as some microporous carbons and silicas).  This model works in the zero-density (high Knudsen-number) limit, and has proven popular as a means of estimating Knudsen transport in this limit, and as a basis for developing density-dependent models.  Most of these density-dependent models extend the zero-density model using approaches that are very different in philosophy to the original model.

The impacts of these changes in fabric on the flow itself are not well understood, and thus novel non-invasive means are needed to observe the interior of the material. Here, we propose a new experimental technique using dynamic X-ray radiography to make such measurements possible. The technique is based on Fourier transformation to extract spatiotemporal fields of internal particle size and shape orientation distributions during flow, in addition to complementary measurements of velocity fields through image correlation. We show X-ray radiography captures the bulk flow properties, in contrastto optical methods which typically measure flow within boundary layers, as these are adjacent to any walls. Our results reveal the rich dynamic alignment of particles with respect to streamlines in the bulk during silo discharge, the understanding of which is critical to preventing destructive instabilities and undesirable clogging.

This behavior is consistent with previous experimental observations and is related to the larger gain in entropy associated with the disordering of ligands on smaller particles or with shorter chains. The transition temperature also increases as the solvent gets more similar to the ligands, which is in direct contradiction to what would be expected according to classical methods for evaluating colloidal stability such as Flory-Huggins solution theory.

<!--<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract24"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  Dense granular flows exhibit fascinating kinematic patterns characterized by strong fluctuations in grain velocities, reminiscent of turbulence [1]. In this talk, we analyse these fluctuations and discuss their role on macroscopic properties such as effective viscosity and shear-induced diffusion. The analysis is based on 2D experimental granular flows performed with the stadium shear device [2] and DEM simulations [3,4]. We first show that, when subjected to shear, grains self-organised into partially jammed clusters rotating like rigid bodies. These so-called âgranular vorticesâ are characterised by a wide distribution in size and very short lifetimes. Strikingly, their average size is found to increase and diverge for lower inertial numbers, when flows decelerate and stop. We then discuss how such an internal length scale, possibly much larger than a grain, may explain three important properties of dense granular flows: (i) the development of boundary layers near walls, where the viscosity is seemingly lower than the viscosity far from walls [2,4]; (ii)  the existence of non-local behaviours as observed and modelled in [5,6]; (iii) the existence of shear-induced diffusion of grains characterized by a shear-rate independent diffusivity [3,7].[1] Radjai, F., & Roux, S.

<!--<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract25"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  Despite the latest improvements to synthesise a great variety of nanoparticles with complex aspherical shapes which revealed a wide range of new phases in colloidal science, many aspects of shape and their effect on the micro-scale can still only be investigated by using computational simulations.<br/><br/>âââAlso tapered ellipsoids, reminiscent of âpear-shaped'' particles, have not been realised in experiments yet. Previous computational studies based on hard Gaussian overlap functions showed, however, that these pears form bicontinuous cubic gyroid phases which are famously found in various biological lipid bilayer systems.<br/><br/>Based on these results we probe an entropic mechanism which enables tapered particles in a mixture dominated by small spheres to spontaneously assemble into micellar structures. Therefore, we perform Monte Carlo simulations with two different tapered particles - pears and tapered spherocylinders - and compare their capability to form micelle clusters. In addition we investigate systems where the micelles themselves form bigger, potentially cubic phases in a hierarchical fashion. From this we expect to get a deeper understanding in the formation of bicontinuous structures in nature and a notion of the similarities and differences between enthalpic and entropic self-assembly. </abstract></td></tr>-->

<!--<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract26"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  Although metallic glasses are well known for strain softening, transient hardening has been evidenced by serrated flow stress and post-relaxation stress overshoot. By simulating cyclic unloading-reloading and shear band âslide-stop-slideâ process of metallic glass Cu50Zr50 , we found that free volume in the shear band changes bifurcately while local fivefold symmetry increases consistently during compressive and tensile relaxation. We propose that the relaxation of structural symmetry, instead of free volume, in the shear band is the atomistic mechanism for transient hardening. An apparent softening phenomenon was also observed when the sample is unloaded from the early or intermediate stage of shear band propagation. This softening results from the inertia of band propagation and is possibly related to material fatigue under cyclic elastic loads. We did not directly observe stress serrations via molecular dynamics simulations due to the very high simulated strain rates. While athermal quasistatic simulations produce serrated flow stress, we note that such serrations result from global avalanches of shear events rather than transient hardening of shear bands. </abstract></td></tr>-->

<!--<tr><td></td><td colspan="2"><abstract id="abstract27"  style="display:none;"> Abstract:  There have been extensive efforts to assemble nanorods into compact monolayers with the rods aligned perpendicular to a substrate or to the plane of a membrane, due to the potential use of such structures in water purification, sensing and solar energy capture. Such assembly, however, has proved difficult to achieve reproducibly as the monolayer structure can often only be accessed kinetically. The synthesis of patchy rods, however, has opened up new possibilities for tuning assembly. Similar to Janus particles, such rods have one or both ends that differ chemically from the rest of the particle. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to characterise the phase behaviour of patchy rods in the presence of an interface and show that a subtle balance between rod-rod and rod-substrate interactions determines whether nucleation and growth of assemblies occurs with the rods oriented parallel or perpendicular to the interface. We find that both surface smectic and crystal phases can form, and that formation of the perpendicular monolayer structure is thermodynamically stable for these particles over a wide range of parameter space, including changes in the rod aspect ratio and the length- and orientation-dependence of the rod-rod and rod-substrate interactions. </abstract></td></tr>-->

One way to cause nanorods to assemble into an ordered structure is the addition of a polymer depletant. We seek to understand the initial nucleation of these structures, and factors that affect the final structure forme. </abstract></td></tr>-->
